# Installation

You’ll need to have Node 10.16.0 or later version on your local development machine (but it’s not required on the server). I recommend using the latest LTS version.

To create a new app, you have to:

Use the following commands

```
git clone https://github.com/jordaoqualho/ready2go-react-template.git
cd ready2go-react-template
npm install / yarn install
npm start / yarn start
```
